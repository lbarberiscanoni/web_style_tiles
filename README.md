web_style_tiles
===============
These are my very first web style tiles!

They are meant to be for the dentist website we worked on at the Iron Yard, but I took it one step further in trying to bring the broader intellectual movements in art history into this.

This repo includes web styles in:
  *De Stijl
  *Suprematist style
  *Modernist style
  
I have used this format for other projects as well, and so far all the clients have really liked it.
